Hi! I’m Adarsh, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University SCS, pursuing Master’s in Computational Data Science. My interests lie at the intersection of AI and Software Systems, and I’m passionate about gaining a comprehensive understanding of how to build and scale production-grade ML systems. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science from BITS Pilani, and I am always looking out for opportunities to add value to real-world software applications. 

I have around 2 years of experience in backend development, building scalable, high-performance micro-services handling millions of live requests. I specialize in backend engineering, distributed systems, and performance optimization, developing robust and efficient software solutions that drive business success.

**Software Development** 
* During my time at Intuit, I primarily worked on modernizing legacy Java systems and developing micro services from scratch, enhancing scalability and reliability to enable new feature development. Previously, at Nutanix, I worked on distributed database systems and conducted JVM performance benchmarking, driving significant improvements in system performance and resource efficiency. 

* My technical toolkit includes industry expertise in Java, SpringBoot, GraphQL, API development, Domain-Driven Design and Performance Benchmarking. 

**Machine Learning** 

* My industrial and academic research projects involved applying ML and DL techniques to address real-world problems such as image captioning, medical imaging and 3D volume reconstruction, and defect prediction in multi-module code repositories. Notably, my work on software defect prediction in multi-module repositories was published in the Q1 journal Expert Systems with Applications (Impact Factor: 8.5). My data science internships at Happiest Minds Technologies and GE Healthcare, and my undergraduate research assistantship have honed my skills in data engineering and predictive modelling.

* My interests revolve around leveraging *AI4SE* and *ML4Code* techniques to model source-code features, improve software quality, and develop scalable AI systems. Excited about leveraging AI to transform and automate software development workflows, improve developer productivity and develop intelligent, production-ready solutions.

Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring aspiring developers, sharing knowledge, and staying updated on the latest developments in AI. Let’s connect if you’re interested in discussing tech trends, potential collaborations, or just want to chat about software engineering and AI!

***Fun Fact**❗* <br> *I am fascinated about cerebral and intellectually stimulating content - unraveling the mysteries of space-time, diving into the depths of human psychology, or pondering philosophical enigmas. My personal favourites include 'Arrival', 'Interstellar', and 'Dark'.*
